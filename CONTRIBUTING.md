### How to contribute

Please feel free to open pull requests for any feature additions or bug fixes you might be inclined to make. Opening an issue to discuss the ask or bug first is a great idea!

### The rules:

1. Keep test coverage at 100%. For something this simple, there's no excuse to miss a single line, branch or statement.
1. Keep it simple. This package is meant to be a simple wrapper with a simple, standard interface.
1. Be nice to one another. In comments, pull request reviews, and anywhere else you have an opportunity to communicate with others. This doesn't only have to apply to your contributions to this package.
